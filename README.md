# Welcome
### This repository was made for JayJay Tech School assignment purposes.

In this repository, we created an automated api and web ui test.

To run the test:
1. Clone this repo's "master" branch to your local computer
2. Open your terminal and then CD it to the project's root
3. Run the command `./gradlew apiTest` for the API test and `./gradlew webTest` for the Web UI test
4. The tests should run immediately
5. After the tests are done, two HTML reports inside the "reports" folder should be available

Thank you.
